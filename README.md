# Movie_Recommender_system
Built a recommender System that recommends the top n movies to a user. 
Used both Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Filtering to recommend. 

To run this, save the dataset in a folder called ml-latest-small and the rest of the files in a folder called "Collaborative Filtering"
Dataset: http://media.sundog-soft.com/RecSys/ml-latest-small.zip
