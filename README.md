# Movie_Recommender_system
- Built a recommender System that recommends the top n movies to a user using Python(Surprise package, KNN). 
- Used both Collaborative Filtering and Content Based Filtering to recommend. 
- Used Evaluation Metrics like RMSE, Hit Rate, Coverage, Novelty and Diversity.

To run this, save the dataset in a folder called ml-latest-small and the rest of the files in a folder called "Collaborative Filtering"
